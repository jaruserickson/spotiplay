Search and start songs from the CLI -- with friends!

## Credit

This project wouldn't be possible without [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) or [Pytify](https://github.com/bjarneo/Pytify). This project was originally forked from Pytify.

spotiplay only has LINUX and OSX support.

*Spotify must be running in the background in order to use this cli remote*

*Spotify should not be interfered with during use for the true rooms experience*

## Installation

Linux users need to install `python-dbus` package.
```bash
$ # Example using apt-get
$Â apt-get install python-dbus
```
to install:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jaruserickson/spotiplay.git
$ cd spotiplay
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

spotiplay must use credentials in order to search for songs. 
1. Register app: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications
2. Edit your `~/.bashrc` to export following values:
```bash
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
```

if missing setup.py misses any requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Usage
```bash
$ spotipy

> /room

```


### Logistics

A socket connection is hosted on Amazon EC2, which stores a dictionary containing multiple other dictionaries each with a unique `key`, a `queue`, and `users`. When the host user performs an action, it is sent to the server, verified for host and then sends a string with the room key and action back to the users. If the room key matches, it will perform the action. 

This app is essentially a heavy socket mask over Pytify, a wonderful app which can be seen at: https://github.com/bjarneo/Pytify
